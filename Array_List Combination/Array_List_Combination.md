Let there be two arrays of strings:String[] Array1String[] Array2Write a method that will take any element of these two arrays and find all characters in common with any element of the other array.i.e. if Array1 = {“dog”, “cat”, “mouse”};and Array2 = {“spot”, “kite”, “moose”};then your method would return “o” for element 1 of array1 and array2 or “mose” for element 3 of array1 and array2.Bonus points: create a more generalized method that will find any data elements in common between any two objects in lists of objects.
